This is a micro-benchmark that compares `binary`, `binary-serialise-cbor`,
`cereal` and `packman` serialization and deserialization performances.

`binary-serialise-cbor` and `packman` are not on Hackage, so we include them
here as Git submodules. Make sure to initialize submodules and add
`binary-serialise-cbor` and `packman` as sources in your Cabal sandbox.
Something like this should work:

```
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
$ cabal sandbox init
$ cabal sandbox add-source packman/
$ cabal sandbox add-source binary-serialise-cbor/
$ cabal install
```

## Results

Versions:

- binary-0.8.3.0
- binary-serialise-cbor-0.1.1.0
- cereal: 0.5.2.0
- packman: 0.2
